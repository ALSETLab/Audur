# Audur
A Platform for Synchrophasor-Based PowerSystem Wide-Area Control System Implementation.

This is a LabVIEW package for developing custom Power System WACS implentations using the NI-cRIO platform.

## Contents:
This package is divided into two parts, utilizing two different synchrophasor data mediation tool-kits, [S3DK](https://github.com/SmarTS-Lab-Parapluie/S3DK) and [Khorjin](https://github.com/SmarTS-Lab-Parapluie/Khorjin-IEC61850-90-5) 
which need to be installed in order use this package.

Each part includes three templates:
  - An empty project, allowing the user to create a custom WACS from scratch.
  - A project including Phasor POD.
  - A project including a Load control algorithm that utilizes the Phasor POD algorithm.
  
## Dependencies:
### LabVIEW extensions:
To utilize this package the following LabVIEW extensions need to be installed:
- LabVIEW Real-Time [link](http://www.ni.com/labview/realtime/)
- LabVIEW FPGA [link](http://www.ni.com/labview/fpga/)
- NI-cRIO compiler (depending on the NI-platform used)[link](http://www.ni.com/white-paper/9381/en/)

### Real-Time Data Mediators:
Audur provides two different templates, depending on the real-time data mediator that you will use and implicitly the control architecture that you will be able to use. These mediators have also been developed by SmarTS-Lab, and are available in the following link:
  - [S3DK](https://github.com/SmarTS-Lab-Parapluie/S3DK): Smart grid Synchrophasor Software Development Kit
  - [Khorjin](https://github.com/SmarTS-Lab-Parapluie/Khorjin-IEC61850-90-5): An IEC 61850-90-5 Gateway for Synchrophasor Data Transfer with support for IEEE C37.118.2
